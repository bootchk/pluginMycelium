Gimp Mycelium Plugin

Copyright 2013 Lloyd Konneker

This is unreleased work in progress.


About
=====

A Gimp plugin that renders an image as mycelium, or threads, or wire.

Generates a new, black and white image from any color or grayscale image.

It ignores the selection and renders the entire image.

Uses cellular automata paradigm.


Derivation
==========

Derived from open source written by Pavol Rusnak (source on GitHub) which was in turn derived from work by Ryan Alexander.


Structure
=========

plugin_mycelium.py is the 'main' of the plugin, that GIMP finds in it's plugin directory.
It is just a shell, most of the action is in the Python package pluginMycelium which it imports from the same directory.

In the package, myceliumGimpPlugin.py is the 'main'.  Other files define classes that it uses.


Dependencies
============

This is a Gimp plugin, so it only works installed as a plugin in Gimp.

This requires the Pixmap package (which I also wrote, and its on Github too.)  
It needs to be installed alongside this
(not in the normal Python way, but in the same directory as Gimp Python plugins.)
